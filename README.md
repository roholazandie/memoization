## Memoization in Python
The present repository contains the code for a bunch of dynamic programming problems that can't be solved in polynomial time using conventional recursive functions.

We try to stay with the same shorter recursive version of the code but using the @lru_cache technique to maintain the 
dynamic programming nature of using memory to reduce complexity by cutting down number of unncessary calls to the same function.
